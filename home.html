        <h3>History</h3>
        </div>
            <p title="History">The Premier League is the top tier of professional football (soccer) in England, widely regarded as one of the most 
            prestigious football leagues globally. It was founded in 1992, replacing the old Football League First Division. 
            The league operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL).
            It began with 22 teams and has since become the top tier of English football with 20 clubs. The league's inception led to a surge in 
            revenue and global popularity, with clubs like Manchester United, Liverpool, and Arsenal leading the way. Over the years, the league has seen 
            significant transformations, including the rise of new powerhouse clubs like Chelsea and Manchester City, along with increased global 
            viewership. Today, the Premier League remains one of the most-watched sports leagues worldwide, known for its competitiveness and high-quality 
            football.</p>

            <h3>Competition Format</h3>
        </div> 
        
        <p>The Premier League operates on a round-robin format where 20 teams compete in 38 matches each season, playing each other twice - 
            once at home and once away. Matches are typically played from August to May, with weekends and occasional weekdays hosting fixtures. 
            Teams earn three points for a win, one for a draw, and none for a loss. The team with the most points at the season's end wins the league title. 
            The top four teams qualify for the UEFA Champions League, while the bottom three are relegated to the English Football League Championship. 
            Domestic cup competitions like the FA Cup and League Cup are separate from the league and don't affect Premier League standings.</p>
